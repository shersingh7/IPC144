In this workshop 5, I learned how to use “Structures” in order to save employee‘s data (Id, age, salary) for four employees. 
Also, by using structures array, I could access each data easily when I had to add, remove employees, and update the salary of the employee.

There are some advantages to using an array of structs compared to using parallel arrays. 
First of all, it is a more efficient and easier way to manage than parallel arrays. 
This is because if we used parallel arrays, which we have to do to create a lot of arrays for many fields, it is very time-consuming. 
On the other hand, if we use an array of structs, we don’t need to create a lot of arrays to represent all the properties of a single entity. 
The reason is that we already created a structure called the employee in my workshop5 and there we stored different type of variables; integers for ID, number, and age; and also double for salary in the same object. 
Besides, if we store multiple arrays at a different location, it would be more complicated. 
So, using an array structure, you can easily understand the code as well. 
Another advantage is that it is easy to access so that when I had to update information for employee3’s salary in the workshop, or remove one of the employees data and add another new employee in the same spot, 
it was easier to access a member of an object with the dot since it’s already in the same index in the same variable. 

In this workshop 5, employee structure is declared in the file. But there is another preferred way of declaring a structure. 
It is by using a header file. This is because if you have multiple c files that require the same structure information, 
it is better to declare the structure in a header file globally so that it can be copied to all the files, which allows us to modify it easily too. 
You can even use it with other c files as many times as you need. 
By declaring structure in a header file, it will save a lot of time as well.

Overall, this workshop helps me to learn how structure works and how to efficiently use it by making an employee data program.
